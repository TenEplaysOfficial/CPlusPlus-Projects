# Registration and Login System

## Description
This project is designed to manage user registration and login functionalities effectively. It utilizes `fstream` for file handling to store user data securely. The system allows users to sign up with their email and password, ensures that email addresses are valid using regular expressions, and checks password length to meet security standards.

### Key Features
- **User Signup**: Allows users to create accounts with unique email addresses.
- **User Login**: Authenticates users using their registered email and password.
- **Forgot Password**: Provides options for users to reset their passwords securely.
- **Email Validation**: Utilizes regular expressions to validate email format.
